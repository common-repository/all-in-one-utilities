Avoid installing multiple plugins for each feature you want to disable. WordPress has too many, and they can consume valuable server resources.

== Description ==

All-in-One Utilities is a versatile plugin that allows administrators to streamline their WordPress site by enabling only the necessary features. Reduce site overhead and manage user roles and settings efficiently with these key features:

1. **User Multiple Roles:** Enables you to assign multiple roles to a user. While WordPress inherently supports this functionality, it does not offer a built-in user interface for it.

With this plugin, the User Edit and Add New User screens will show a checklist of roles instead of the default role dropdown. Additionally, the main User List screen will display all roles assigned to each user.

2. **Username Updater:** Allows administrators to change usernames on their site. Easily update usernames for users via a dedicated form accessible from the user list table. Send the updated username to users via email.

3. **Set Featured Image:** Automatically sets a default featured image for posts to maintain a clean blog archive page layout.

4. **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Want to boost your website's performance without relying solely on a caching plugin or investing in costly hosting? Enhance Your Website Performance by Disabling Unnecessary Features. Disable various WordPress features like author archives, application passwords, adjacent posts, and more to streamline your site. The key is to avoid loading unnecessary bloat
